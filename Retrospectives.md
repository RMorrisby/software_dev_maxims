# Retrospective part 1 : soliciting items to discuss.

This can be done in person at the start of the session, or beforehand. Each person should :

## Think of three (or more) things that went well for the project, the team and/or you

E.g. "we released X on time", "Y helped me out of nasty problem Z"

- 
- 
- 


## Think of three (or more) things the project, the team and/or you could have done better

E.g. "X caused large delays", "Y and Z weren't communicated well, causing us a lot of frustration and wasted time", "morale is very low"

- 
- 
- 


### Timeframe

The timeframe for these two categories is between the last time you did a retrospective and now. If this is your first retrospective, consider everything that happened in the last Sprint, or the last month.



# Retrospective part 1 : discussing items.

No two groups of people will ever do this in exactly the same way, but everyone should try to adhere to these groundrules :

- Never forget the purpose of these sessions. These sessions exist to identify problems faced by the team, so that they might be fixed and the team can be happier and more productive.
- Don't shoot the messenger. 
-- Everyone may speak freely. No-one should ever be afraid to speak up. There must be no recrimination if someone reports a problem that some people perhaps don't want to hear.
-- If the team can't foster this egalitarian atmosphere, the team has serious - possibly fatal - problems.
- Everyone gets equal chance to speak.
-- Some people may have more items to discuss than others.
-- People should prioritise the items they wish to discuss, most important ones first.
- For every negative/"we could have done this better" item, discuss how it could have been prevented and how it can be prevented in the future.
-- It is possible that the group concludes that this was a one-off occurrance, or a necessary price to pay for a benefit the team received.
- For every negative/"we could have done this better" item, record one (or more) Actions and assign them to the appropriate person.
-- These Actions should be recorded in the team's Action log (which might be their Sprint plan, Backlog or another work-tracker). 
-- These Actions must not be forgotten! The team agreed that these Actions should be done, so why isn't the team doing them?


## Categories/Schemes

There are a number of different categories or schemes a team might use with these discussion items, e.g. "Good vs. Bad", "Good, Bad and Neutral", "What Went Well & Even Better If", etc. The team should choose the one they feel best helps prompt discussion and reveal problems the team has been encountering.

Here are a few :

- What Went Well & Even Better If
- Glad, Sad, Mad
- Superb, Good, Bad, Appalling
- What is lifting us up, what is dragging us down?
- Where are we strong, where are we weak?
